# Project 4
Empirical Investigation with Finance Data from CORGIS

The main branch is all of the data wrangling. The order of the file running to arrive at finance.csv from finance.data is:
1. making_a_dataframe.py
2. data_wrangling.py

Then, everyone's individual data exploration and visualization is in their respective branch as a new python file.
